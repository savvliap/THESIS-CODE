# Description 

In this project I am implementing peumonia are detection in chest X-rays. In particular 
some classification architectures will be applied to chest radiographs that have
collected in digital format, to determine whether there is a shift in the
lung or not. The dataset that has been collected has been tagged by health experts 
and the goal is to find a model that will predictions that are as close as possible to
these predictions. More specifically, Ï‘the Unet, DoubleUnet, Res-Unet, Inception-Unet, Dense-Unet 
architectures will be considered and compared in terms of the success of not only correctly 
classifying images, but also highlighting problem areas, where they exist. Besides, 
I will consider techniques through which it would be possible to improve the result, such as
techniques for managing the dataset, but without any substantial intervention in it.
